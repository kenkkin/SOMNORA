Experience Goals  
In Somnora, as players descend into deeper layers of dreams, they encounter an increasing level of chaos, where familiar elements blend with the surreal, creating a profound sense of disorientation. Each layer amplifies the confusion, distorting the boundaries of reality and making it harder to distinguish between the ordinary and the bizarre.
